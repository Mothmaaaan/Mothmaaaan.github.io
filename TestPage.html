		<p class="text-section"><em>KiBo</em> was an experimental project that me and a buddy worked on right after we both finished our degrees. It was an extremely rewarding game to work on due to how challenging it ended up being. I was extremely focused on networking challenges and player conveyance throughout the three weeks we had for the project. <em>KiBo</em> was created for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/tgcxcoreblazer" target="_blank" style="color: gold">thatgamecompany x COREBLAZER GAME JAM 2025</a>, which released the theme of generosity. After a few brainstorming sessions, the idea of <em>ending your own gameplay experience to allow future players to progress further than you</em> was what we settled on. Thus, the main concept of praying to turn into a statue was born and <em>KiBo</em> was created.</p>
		
		<!-- NETWORKING TOPIC -->
		<h1 class="header-section" style="padding-top: 12%; padding-bottom: 4%;">-------- Networking Struggles --------</h1>
		<p class="text-section" style="padding-bottom: 4%;">I created a DirectConnectionManager which had enough versatility to allow me to toggle if a build of KiBo should be a server or client build. This script was also engineered in mind to allow for the  server to shut down and move to a different machine. Player’s statue positions are saved to the server machine and reloaded when the server starts up. I also wanted to have versatility if too many players were playing the game too fast; this led to the creation of a script that initialized the torches (number of players needed) over the network when the server first starts up. This way, I can shut the server down, move the statue save over to a new machine if necessary, and relaunch the server in the exact same state it was in before it shut down!</p>

			<p class="side-text">Creating KiBo meant creating a multiplayer experience in a very short amount of time (approximately three weeks). Now, I am no stranger to multiplayer, having created many small projects in the past. However, creating something this fast was new to me. I also needed to experiment with a new server architecture, as peer-to-peer would not let all the players affect one grand total of statues. My solution was (admittedly rushed due to lack of experience) to run a server off my laptop and allow all players to connect directly to it during the duration of the jam.</p>

			<p class="side-text">There were a few challenges during our three-week sprint. Inverse Kinematics was something I had very little experience with, and it took a lot of trial and error to have the hands move in a way that I felt was appropriate for a creature like KiBo. I ended up with a GrabManager script which informed Hand scripts on where to smoothly translate the IK target to.</p>

		<div class="side-by-side">
			<p class="side-text">Just one day before the game was due for submission, we ran a playtest with only two players… and the server crashed in under three minutes. I was distraught. Getting to work immediately, I found the issue to be how large the packets were that each client was sending to the server. I found the issue (which ended up being completely, 100% my fault) and was able to write a new script that compiled the IK target information and send that over the network. This was necessary as before I had attached a NetworkTransform component to every bone that IKs were affecting; over 30 bones per player updating every frame (oops!).</p>

		<!-- POST MORTEM SECTION -->
		<h1 class="header-section" style="padding-top: 4%; padding-bottom: 4%;">-------- Post-Mortem --------</h1>
		<p class="text-section" style="padding-bottom: 4%;">KiBo has grown to become my favorite project I have worked on. There were so many different elements that took a lot of trial and error, and I learned more in those three weeks than I did over the course of some entire projects. As demanding as it was, I will work twice as hard for the next game jam I participate in. I hope to carry some of the procedural animation tactics I learned into my future projects, bringing even more life into whatever experience I am creating.</p>
